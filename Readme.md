This tool is in development and based on the [ACExplorer repository](https://github.com/gentlegiantJGC/ACExplorer) 
by [gentlegiantJGC](https://github.com/gentlegiantJGC).

I want to achieve the following goals:
- running on Mac
- GUI interface to unpack AC1 to ACU game files
- Add already created for ACU data blocks exporting for earlier games
